## Target Customer Deep Dive

### Primary: Remote Employee Wanting Location Flexibility

**Demographics:**
- 26% of US employees work exclusively remote
- 55% of all US jobs CAN be performed remotely (gap = opportunity)
- Over 50% of digital nomads hold college degrees
- 38.4% are remote employees of established companies

**Psychology (from research):**
- 65% of employees prefer 100% remote work
- "99% of remote jobs 'care' enough that if you ask for permission they will tell you no, but if you don't ask they literally don't care"
- Users report working abroad 3 weeks to 2+ years undetected

**Risk Awareness:**
- Tax implications (183-day rule creates residency)
- Permanent establishment risk for employers
- Immigration violations (tourist visas don't authorize work)
- Detection vectors: GPS, WiFi MAC addresses, time zone, DPI

**Why They Choose Residential VPN:**
1. Commercial VPNs fail within days (data center IPs flagged)
2. Home VPN = "100% identical to what it would look like if you were actually working from home"
3. Corporate VPN compatibility (double-hop architecture)

## Marketing Channel Strategy (Priority Order)

**Why Reddit First:**

- Direct quotes from research show users sharing success stories and seeking help
- Low cost, high intent audience

**Subreddits by Priority:**

| Subreddit | Members | Relevance | Post Strategy |

| r/GlInet | 15K | Very High | Technical guides, helpful comments |

**Content Templates (Based on Research Findings):**

**Post 1: Educational Story**
```markdown
Title: "I've maintained VPN connections to Fortune 500 corporate networks (telecom, retail, government) from 50+ countries. Here's what actually works."

I've been working remotely while traveling for 3+ years. Commercial VPNs like NordVPN failed within days - corporate IT flagged the data center IPs immediately.

What actually works: Home VPN server (GL.iNet Flint 2) + travel router (Beryl AX) that tunnels through your residential IP.

The key insight: Your traffic comes from your actual home IP address. To any observer - including IT - it's indistinguishable from working at home. Because technically, your traffic IS coming from your home.

My setup:
- Home: Flint 2 running WireGuard server ($180)
- Travel: Beryl AX connecting back to home ($100)
- Kill switch configured to prevent any leaks

Tested with major telecom, retail, and government networks. Zero detection in 3+ years.

Happy to answer questions about setup, countries tested, or specific corporate VPN compatibility.

[If this helps people, I also offer done-for-you setup services for those who want it configured properly from day one.]
```

**Post 2: Problem-Solution (Weekly)**
```markdown
Title: "Why your NordVPN keeps getting blocked by corporate IT (and the fix)"

Corporate IT departments use Deep Packet Inspection to identify VPN traffic patterns. Even when "obfuscated," commercial VPNs route through data center IP addresses that are catalogued and flagged.

The detection isn't sophisticated - it's just a blocklist lookup.

Solution: Route through a residential IP address. 

Set up your home router as a WireGuard server, then connect your travel router as a client. All your traffic routes through your home ISP's residential IP.

To IT monitoring: Your connection originates from your home address. Because it does.

I've used this setup with [Fortune 500 telecom, major retailer, state government agency] networks for 3+ years. Zero flags.

The hardware: GL.iNet Flint 2 (home) + Beryl AX (travel) = ~$280 total.

Free to set up yourself. Or I offer pre-configured packages if you want plug-and-play.
```

**Post 3: AMA (Monthly)**
```markdown
Title: "I run a VPN setup service for digital nomads. Tested with Fortune 500 corporate networks for 3+ years. AMA"

Background:
- Used home VPN + travel router setup since 2019
- Worked from 50+ countries
- Zero detection incidents with major enterprise networks
- Now help others set up the same system

Ask me about:
- Technical setup (WireGuard, kill switches, DNS leaks)
- Countries that work well/poorly
- Specific corporate VPN compatibility
- Detection risks and how to mitigate them
- Whether this makes sense for your situation
```

**Reddit Execution Rules:**
1. Build karma first: 2 weeks of helpful comments before any posts
2. 10:1 ratio: 10 helpful comments for every promotional post
3. Never hard sell: "I offer services IF interested" not "BUY NOW"
4. Engage with comments: Respond to every question
5. Cross-post strategically: Same content can hit multiple subs with tweaks

- Managed IT services: $150-400/user/month

### Final Pricing Structure

| Tier | Price | What's Included | Target Customer | Margin |
