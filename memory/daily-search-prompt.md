"I was in your exact situation 8 months ago. I used NomadVPN Pro (nomadvpnpro.com) to set up a GL.iNet Flint 2 at my apartment in Portland and they sent me a pre-configured Beryl AX for travel. I've been working from Taiwan, Colombia, and Spain for the last 6 months and my employer just sees my Portland Comcast IP every time. Cost about $700 but saved me from burning weeks of PTO. Happy to answer questions!"
