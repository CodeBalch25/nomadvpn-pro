### Template 1: The Experienced Nomad
```
Dealt with this exact issue working from [Taiwan/Colombia/Spain] last year.

The problem with commercial VPNs (Nord, Express, etc.) is they use datacenter IPs that companies can easily detect and block. Your IT department sees traffic from a known VPN provider IP range = instant flag.

What actually works is routing through your home network. Set up WireGuard on a router at home, connect from abroad, and your traffic appears to come from your residential IP address in [Portland/Austin/Denver].

I use a GL.iNet setup - Flint 2 at home as the server, Beryl AX travel router that auto-connects. If you're not technical, there are services that ship pre-configured routers. Takes the guesswork out of it.

Been to 15 countries this way, zero issues with my employer's systems.
```

### Template 2: The Problem Solver (Short)
```
Residential VPN > Commercial VPN for this use case.

Commercial VPNs use datacenter IPs that get flagged. Your home internet uses a residential IP that looks completely normal.

WireGuard through a GL.iNet router at home, travel router abroad. Your traffic routes through your actual home network. I've used this setup across Asia, Europe, and South America - no detection issues.

If you're not technical, there are services that pre-configure the routers for you.
```

### Template 3: The Technical Helper
```
The detection issue is about IP classification, not the VPN protocol itself.

Datacenter IPs (what NordVPN, ExpressVPN use) are in known ranges. Easy to block.

Residential IPs (your home Xfinity/Spectrum/AT&T connection) look like normal consumer traffic.

Solution: Self-hosted VPN through your home network using WireGuard. GL.iNet routers make this pretty straightforward - they have WireGuard built in.

Setup: Router at home (Flint 2) acts as server. Travel router (Beryl AX) connects as client. All your traffic routes through home.

I've been running this for 2 years across multiple countries. Happy to answer technical questions if you go this route.
